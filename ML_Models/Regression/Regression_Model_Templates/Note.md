# NOTE:
You can use these templates to any dataset, but the condition is the dependent variable should be present in the last column.

# Why these templates?
When you are in hurry and you don't know which Algorithm to use on the dataset then you can pass the dataset to these models and at last you'll find which model gives the best accuracy using R2-Squared.
